Hello, I'm Jean Claude!

I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. I'm a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience in the Aerospace & Defense industry. Throughout my time, I've had the privilege of being part of a rotational program that has exposed me to various disciplines such as SWE, DevOps, Systems Engineering (SE), and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

You see that satellite in space? Yeah I most likely contributed to getting it up there. I am constantly learning and evolving as the vastness of knowledge is never-ending. 

C++ is my personal favorite language but don't tell Java I said that. Outside of work I enjoy bodybuilding, reading, and traveling. A fun fact, I have been to 6 countries with many more on my radar. Oh... I also might fly planes for fun, very exciting stuff! I'm also eyeing a couple more licenses/ratings but a PPL will suffice for *now*.
